# Welcome to the atom-doxit-plus package website

## Overview
This is a very simple package to insert Doxygen comment templates, using the packages menu or a keyboard shortcut. Two types of comment can be inserted at the current cursor position:
- file header comment: Contains file information (author, copyright, description, etc.)
- function description comment: Contains basic details to describe the function.
Fields are automatically completed where possible (dates, author name).

## Customization
The author name is automatically detected if in a project repository; otherwise, the default Joe Bloggs will be shown
The keyboard shortcuts are configurable.


## Authors and Contributors
This package was originally created by Cameron A. Craig (@camieac).
This clone is owned and maintained by Joshua Bas (@JBas). Additional contributors will be added here as necessary (any help to improve the package is greatly appreciated).
